MS XMR Testing is a lightweight experimental framework designed for benchmarking, stress-testing, and monitoring Monero (XMR) mining performance on different systems.
This project focuses on:

✅ Testing mining performance under various CPU loads

✅ Evaluating MSR tweaks and optimization settings

✅ Stability checks and temperature monitoring

✅ Logging hash rates, rejections, and CPU utilization

✅ Auto-restart logic for miner crash protection
